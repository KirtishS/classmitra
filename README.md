# Class Mitra

## Description
In todays day and age of online learning, it is important to have an online platform such that students can submit their assignments, teachers can assess them and return back the results. Hence, we have made Classroom to accomplish this task.
Connect with your classes and do assignments on the go.

Classmitra is a free service for schools, non-profits, and any individual. Classmitra makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classmitra saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized. 

There are many benefits to using Classmitra:
• Easy to set up – Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.
• Saves time – The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.
• Improves organization – Students can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.
• Enhances communication – Classmitra allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.
• Secure – Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classmitra contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.
